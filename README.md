# About

Put a high-level student `CRM` into a graph database.

## Why

1.  Even if you are deploying something via another solution (i.e. Salesforce), the graph model might be helpful for simply looking at your data model differently.  For example, you could look at the tree of dependencies when debugging a workflow rule or process builder.  
2.  Why not use the graph database as the backend and define your business logic wherever you prefer.
